Group Project with Chris Li and Evan Berret
This Django-based web application provides a restaurant search and review platform. 
Using HTML, CSS, and Python for the backend, the app integrates the Places API to search for restaurants based on location. 
Users can filter restaurants by distance and rating, view detailed information such as reviews, and access an interactive map displaying each restaurant's location. 
The application features user authentication, allowing users to mark restaurants as favorites and leave their own reviews. 
All restaurant data, favorites, and reviews are stored in a database for efficient retrieval and management.

My Task: Handled all Back End functionality of this project including handling apis and handling integration.
